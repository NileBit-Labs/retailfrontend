# Contributing to retailfrontend

Vue 3 + Vite + TypeScript app for NileBit Retail POS.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NileBit-Labs/retailfrontend.git
cd retailfrontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

App is now at `http://localhost:5173`. It expects the backend (`retailbackend`, see its own CONTRIBUTING.md) running at `http://localhost:8200` (a pinned non-default port — the backend's `SERVER_PORT` env var — so it doesn't collide with any other Laravel project's default 8000) — `.env`'s `VITE_API_URL` points at it. The app will refuse to start without `.env` present (fails loudly rather than silently calling the wrong URL).

If the login/register form suddenly shows "The route api/... could not be found" after previously working, check nothing else is running on port 8200 (`lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN`) before assuming the code broke — that error means *some* server answered, just not this one.

Run `npm run build` before opening a PR — it must pass (type-check + build).

## Module ownership

| Person | Track |
| --- | --- |
| Elioda Muhangi (CTO) | Foundation (login/auth, API client), Sales/POS, offline sync, Customers & Credit, Expenses, Refunds & Shifts screens |
| Collins Shema (COO) | Products, Inventory, Suppliers, Purchases screens |
| Douglas Bagambe (CEO) | Users/Staff, Settings, Dashboard, Reports screens |

Stick to your own module's views/components/stores unless coordinating a shared change (e.g. the Pinia `auth`/`shop` stores, shared layout/nav) — flag those in a PR description or ask before touching another track's files.

## Patterns to follow

- **Talk to the API only through `apiFetch`** (`src/lib/api.ts`). It adds the token and `X-Shop-Id`, times out after 15s, and turns failures into `ApiError`; use `apiErrorMessage(e)` to show a readable message and `isNetworkFailure(e)` to tell "the server said no" from "couldn't reach the server".
- **Money is an integer number of UGX** everywhere; format it with `formatUgx`. Totals you show are for display — the server recomputes and is the authority.
- **Writes that matter must survive a bad connection.** Give the action one idempotency key for its whole life and reuse it on retry (see the cart's checkout). Sales already queue offline; if your module adds a write that shops will do without internet, route it through the same outbox/sync path rather than inventing another.
- **Follow the design tokens** in `src/assets/base.css` (`--color-*`, `--radius-*`, `.card`, `.btn`, `.field`) so light and dark mode both work. Don't hard-code colours; use `--color-on-primary` for text on primary backgrounds.
- **Add your screen to `src/router/nav.ts`** with `ready: true` and a real route in `src/router/index.ts`; use `managerOnly: true` for screens cashiers shouldn't see (the server still enforces it).
- **Screens live inside the app shell.** The sidebar and header are fixed and only the content area scrolls, so never size a page with `100vh`/`100dvh`. Use `.ui-page` (fills the width, capped at 1680px) or `flex: 1`; the Sell screen is the model for a screen that fills the height.
- **Lists get `PaginationBar`** (`src/components/PaginationBar.vue`): "Showing 1–25 of 60", rows per page (10/25/50/100, remembered per list) and page numbers. Lists the server pages send `per_page` (use `usePerPage`); lists the server sends whole use `useClientPage` from `src/lib/paging.ts`.
- **Test in a browser**, on a phone-sized viewport too. Type-checking and a build don't tell you the till is usable.

## Working offline (the installed app)

The app can be installed from the browser and opens with no connection. A service worker, written to `dist/sw.js` by the `appShell` plugin in `vite.config.ts`, saves the app's own files; the API is never cached there (sales and the catalogue are kept by the app itself in IndexedDB).

- It only runs in a production build, so `npm run dev` is never affected. To try it: `npm run build && npx vite preview`, open the preview address, then turn the network off in DevTools and reload.
- Nothing to maintain by hand: every build lists its own files and gets a new version. A new version waits until the person taps **Reload** on the banner, so nobody is reloaded in the middle of a sale.
- The signed-in account (name and roles) is kept on the device so a reload while offline still shows the right menu. The server still decides what anyone may do.
- When you add a screen that loads data, catch the failure and show a message. Offline is a normal state here, not an error to crash on.

## Branching & PRs

- Branch off `main`: `feature/<your-module>-<short-description>` (e.g. `feature/pos-cart-discounts`)
- No direct pushes to `main` — open a PR, get at least one review before merging
- Keep PRs scoped to one module/feature at a time
